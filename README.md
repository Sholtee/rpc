## How it works
1. The client sends a *HTTP POST* to the server where 
   - The request *URI*
     - Must use *HTTP* or *HTTPS* scheme
     - Identifies the remote *module* and *method* (in the query component)
     - May contain the *sessionid* (in the query component)
   
     For example: `http://www.example.org:1986/api?module=IMyModule&method=ModuleMethod&sessionid=xXx`. 
   - The *content-type* is `application/json`
   - The *body* is an (UTF-8) *JSON* stringified array that contains the method arguments. For example: `["cica", 10]`.
2. The type of response depends on the kind of the result:
   - If the remote method has a non `Stream` return value then the *content-type* is `application/json` and the response body contains the (UTF-8) *JSON* stringified result. The result is a wrapped object that contains the actual outcome of the method or the error description:
     ```js
     {
       "Result": 12,
	   "Exception": null
     }
     ```
	 or
     ```js
     {
       "Result": null,
	   "Exception": {
         "TypeName": "System.Exception, System.Private.CoreLib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e",
         "Message": "Exception of type 'System.Exception' was thrown.",
         "Data": {}
       }
     }
     ```	 
   - If the remote method has a `Stream` return value (and the invocation was successful) then the *content-type* is `application/octet-stream` and the response body contains the raw data.
